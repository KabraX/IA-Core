# 📂 .cursor

This directory contains a collection of **rules and configurations** that I commonly use in my projects with [Cursor](https://cursor.com/home).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Gather rules that help me maintain a consistent workflow.
- Make AI adapt better to my programming and documentation flow.
- Share these guidelines with the community so they can be **reused or adapted** easily.

---

## 🔄 Adaptability

Although these rules were initially designed for Cursor, many of them can also be applied to:

- **GitHub Copilot**
- **Other language models**
- **Custom development environments**

Each file inside `.cursor` can serve as a base for your own configuration.  
Feel free to modify and adjust them according to your style and needs.

## 📝 Note

The rules presented here reflect **my personal way** of configuring AI.  
They are not universal standards, but rather an open starting point for anyone to create their own working environment.
