## Key Files & Structure

### Entry Points

Here we define the main files of the project, which form the fundamental skeleton of the application. It is recommended to start by reviewing these files, as they provide a clear overview of the basic structure and core functionality of the system.

### Core Logic

In this section, all files that comprise the fundamental logic—the brain of the project—are defined.

### Configuration

In this section, all configuration files used in the project are defined.

## Architecture Overview

The [PROJECT TYPE] follows a modular architecture with clear separation between:

- **[LAYER 1]**: [DESCRIPTION OF LAYER 1]
- **[LAYER 2]**: [DESCRIPTION OF LAYER 2]
- **[LAYER 3]**: [DESCRIPTION OF LAYER 3]
- **[LAYER 4]**: [DESCRIPTION OF LAYER 4]

This structure makes the codebase maintainable and extensible for future [PROJECT DOMAIN] needs.
