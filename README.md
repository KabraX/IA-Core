# 🤖 IA-Core

**Repository dedicated to sharing how I want AI to think.**

This project is meant to be a public space where I document and share the way I configure and interact with AI tools.  
The goal is to build a clear, adaptable set of rules, prompts, and workflows that anyone can reuse or customize.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Show how I structure and organize AI rules.
- Encourage others to explore and adapt these approaches.
- Contribute to a more transparent and collaborative way of working with AI.

---

## 🔄 Adaptability

Everything here is intended to be flexible:

- Use it as-is if it fits your workflow.
- Modify the rules to match your style.
- Mix and match across tools like **Cursor**, **GitHub Copilot**, or other AI-powered IDE assistants.

## 🤝 Contributions

I’m sharing this repository to spark collaboration and learning.  
If you want to improve, extend, or showcase how you adapt these rules to your own tools, feel free to open an _issue_ or a _pull request_.

## 📝 Note

These configurations reflect **my personal approach** to working with AI.  
They are not definitive standards—just an open invitation to experiment, adapt, and evolve your own AI-driven workflow.
